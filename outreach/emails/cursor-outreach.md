Subject: Editor Integration - TypeScript Type Guard Generation for Cursor

Dear Cursor Team,

I've developed Guardz MCP, a specialized API for TypeScript type guard generation that would enhance Cursor's AI-powered editing capabilities.

## Editor Integration Benefits
- Context-aware type guard generation
- Real-time code validation
- Seamless developer workflow
- Enhanced TypeScript support

## Technical Integration
- RESTful API with comprehensive endpoints
- Editor-specific integration code
- Context-aware suggestions
- Code quality enhancement

## Ready for Cursor
I've prepared Cursor-specific integration:
- Editor integration: https://thiennp.github.io/AI-PLATFORM-INTEGRATION.md
- Context-aware generation
- Command definitions
- Menu integration

Would you be interested in exploring this integration for Cursor? I can provide technical specifications and integration examples.

Best regards,
Thien Nguyen
