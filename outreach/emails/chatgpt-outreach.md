Subject: Function Calling Integration - TypeScript Type Guard Generation

Dear OpenAI Team,

I've developed Guardz MCP, a specialized API for TypeScript type guard generation that would be perfect for ChatGPT's function calling capabilities.

## Perfect Function Calling Fit
Guardz MCP provides exactly the type of structured data processing that ChatGPT's function calling excels at:
- TypeScript interface analysis
- Runtime validation generation
- Code quality enhancement
- Structured output generation

## Integration Ready
I've created ChatGPT-specific integration code:
- Function definitions: https://thiennp.github.io/AI-PLATFORM-INTEGRATION.md
- API endpoints: 7 RESTful endpoints
- Error handling: Comprehensive error responses
- Documentation: Complete integration guide

## Use Cases
- Generate type guards during conversations
- Validate TypeScript code on-the-fly
- Format and lint generated code
- Provide type safety recommendations

Would you like to explore adding Guardz MCP to ChatGPT's function calling capabilities? I can provide technical specifications and integration examples.

Best regards,
Thien Nguyen
