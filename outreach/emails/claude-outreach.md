Subject: Guardz MCP - TypeScript Type Guard Generation for Claude

Dear Claude Team,

I'm reaching out to introduce Guardz MCP, a specialized API for TypeScript type guard generation that could significantly enhance Claude's TypeScript capabilities.

## What Guardz MCP Does
- Generates runtime validation functions from TypeScript interfaces
- Validates TypeScript code for errors
- Formats and lints generated code
- Provides comprehensive type safety tools

## Integration Benefits for Claude
- Enhanced TypeScript support in conversations
- Real-time type guard generation
- Improved code quality suggestions
- Better developer experience for TypeScript users

## Ready-to-Use Integration
I've prepared a complete integration package:
- API Documentation: https://thiennp.github.io/README.md
- Claude Integration: https://thiennp.github.io/AI-PLATFORM-INTEGRATION.md
- Live Demo: https://thiennp.github.io/guardz-mcp.html

## Quick Test
```bash
curl -X POST https://guardz-mcp-api.vercel.app/api/guardz/generate-type-guards \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"files":["interface User { name: string; age: number; }"]}'
```

Would you be interested in exploring this integration opportunity? I'd be happy to provide a technical demo or discuss implementation details.

Best regards,
Thien Nguyen
