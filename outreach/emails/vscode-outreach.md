Subject: Extension Marketplace - TypeScript Type Guard Generation

Dear VS Code Extensions Team,

I've developed Guardz MCP, a specialized API for TypeScript type guard generation that would be perfect for the VS Code Extensions marketplace.

## Extension Benefits
- Type guard generation commands
- Real-time validation
- Code quality enhancement
- Seamless developer workflow

## Technical Integration
- RESTful API with 7 endpoints
- VS Code extension configuration
- Command implementations
- Marketplace integration

## Ready for Marketplace
I've prepared VS Code-specific integration:
- Extension configuration: https://thiennp.github.io/AI-PLATFORM-INTEGRATION.md
- Command implementations
- User interface components
- Marketplace integration

Would you be interested in exploring this integration for the VS Code Extensions marketplace? I can provide technical specifications and integration examples.

Best regards,
Thien Nguyen
