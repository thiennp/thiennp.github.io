Subject: Plugin System - TypeScript Type Guard Generation for JetBrains IDEs

Dear JetBrains Team,

I've developed Guardz MCP, a specialized API for TypeScript type guard generation that would be perfect for JetBrains IDE plugin system.

## Plugin Benefits
- Type guard generation tools
- Real-time validation
- Code quality enhancement
- Seamless developer workflow

## Technical Integration
- RESTful API with 7 endpoints
- Plugin configuration
- Tool window integration
- Action implementations

## Ready for Plugin System
I've prepared JetBrains-specific integration:
- Plugin configuration: https://thiennp.github.io/AI-PLATFORM-INTEGRATION.md
- Tool window integration
- Action implementations
- IntelliJ/WebStorm support

Would you be interested in exploring this integration for JetBrains IDEs? I can provide technical specifications and integration examples.

Best regards,
Thien Nguyen
