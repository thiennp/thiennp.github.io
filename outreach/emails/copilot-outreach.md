Subject: IDE Integration - TypeScript Type Guard Generation for Copilot

Dear GitHub Copilot Team,

I've developed Guardz MCP, a specialized API for TypeScript type guard generation that would be perfect for Copilot's IDE integration capabilities.

## IDE Integration Benefits
- Real-time type guard suggestions
- Automatic validation generation
- Code quality enhancement
- Seamless developer workflow

## Technical Integration
- RESTful API with 7 endpoints
- TypeScript interface definitions
- Auto-completion suggestions
- Code generation patterns

## Ready for Copilot
I've prepared Copilot-specific integration:
- TypeScript interfaces: https://thiennp.github.io/AI-PLATFORM-INTEGRATION.md
- IDE integration examples
- Auto-completion patterns
- Code generation templates

Would you be interested in exploring this integration for Copilot? I can provide technical specifications and integration examples.

Best regards,
Thien Nguyen
